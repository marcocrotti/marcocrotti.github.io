I obtained a bachelor's degree from the University of Derby, where I studied a Bsc in Zoology. For my thesis, 
I conducted fieldwork in the island of Mafia, Tanzania, looking at and comparing amphibian assemblages across different ecosystems.

That project sparked an interest in taxonomy, which led me to study a master in Taxonomy and Biodiversity at Imperial College London and
the Natural History Museum. I did not stray away too much from my undergraduate topic in my master's thesis, as I focused on the biogeography 
of one African frog, *Afrixalus fornasini*, across its range. This project led in the end to an interesting, although a bit methodsy, 
paper on the impact and causes of missing data in RADseq phylogenies (see publications).

After that, I moved to the University of Glasgow for my phd, where I worked in the lab of [Kathryn Elmer](http://elmerlab.blogspot.com/),
looking at the biogeography and conservation of European whitefish *Coregonus lavaretus* in Scotland.

Currently I am working at [Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology](https://ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/) as a Research Associate. My role involve the 
analysis of whole exome sequencing data from the [BRIDGES project](https://bridges-research.eu/) to identify variants with
an association with breast cancer.


Recently I became an instructor for the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), and helped with the teaching and organising of a few workshops. In addition, 
I have acted as consultant for [Physalia](https://www.physalia-courses.org/), helping the client with their genomic project.
