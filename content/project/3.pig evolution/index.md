This is a project I started with a palaeontologist friend on mine for fun few years ago. 
The overall aim is to better understand the taxonomy and evolutionary history of extinct suids, 
a group for which we have lots of material (fossils) but that currently suffer from taxonomic confusion.

In the [first article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2018.06.029) of the project, we 
describe a mandible belonging to *Sus strozzii* from the site of Pantalla, Italy; from there, 
we reconstruct the most comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the subfamily suinae, disproving 
previous hypotheses of species relationships. 

A [second article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2020.106234) deals with the study of suid fossils from the Middle-Pleistocene
of Spain. More importantly, for the first time we show with statistical approaches the difference
between "verrucosic" and "scrofic" canines, which is an important character for species 
distinction within the genus *Sus*.
