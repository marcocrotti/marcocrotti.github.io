Understanding how colonisation of novel environments and the frequently associated reduction in population size and genetic variation affect founder populations is a major question in evolutionary and conservation biology. Translocations have become an important tool for species conservation, but small population sizes and new ecological pressures might lead to the phenotypic and genotypic divergence of translocated populations. 
Divergent methylation patterns have been reported between individuals experiencing divergent environmental conditions and, similarly, it has been suggested that epigenetic modifications might compensate for low genetic diversity in bottlenecked populations. While it has been shown that colonisation of a new environment can lead to rapid divergence in phenotypic traits between source and colonising population, the drivers of this divergence and their interaction are not well understood: is phenotypic plasticity, e.g. through epigenetic modifications, the main reason for rapid phenotypic divergence? Is genetic drift the main force behind divergence? Or is phenotypic divergence mainly the result of very rapid genetic adaptation to the new environmental pressures? 
In Scotland, European whitefish Coregonus lavaretus is natively present in only two lakes, but six refuge populations were established over the last 30 years. We know from phenotypic analyses that these refuge populations have already diverged from the source in several traits after few generations. Therefore, these translocations provide an excellent study system to disentangle the effect of plasticity, drift, and selection in promoting the observed phenotypic divergence between source and colonising populations, and to better understand the impacts colonisation has on the evolution of natural populations.
