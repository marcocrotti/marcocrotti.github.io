European whitefish _Coregonus lavaretus_ is a very widespread species, ranging from western Europe to Siberia. There are currently two to three recognised major mitochondrial lineages, which have evolved in allopatry during the last ice age.
In the UK there are seven native populations of whitefish, but their relationship with continental populations is still unknown. The aim of this project is to reconstruct the biogeography and demographic history of European whitefish in the British Isles.
