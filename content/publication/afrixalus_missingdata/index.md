abstract: Restriction site‐associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) has emerged as a useful tool 
 in systematics and population genomics. A common feature of RADseq data sets is that they 
 contain missing data that arise from multiple sources including genealogical sampling 
 bias, assembly methodology and sequencing error. Many RADseq studies have demonstrated 
 that allowing sites (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) with missing data can 
 increase support for phylogenetic hypotheses. Two non‐mutually exclusive explanations 
 for this observation are that (a) larger data sets contain more phylogenetic information; 
 and (b) excluding missing data disproportionally removes sites with the highest mutation 
 rates, causing the exclusion of characters that are likely variable and informative. 
 Using a RADseq data set derived from the East African banana frog, *Afrixalus fornasini* 
 (up to 1.1 million SNPs), we found that missing data thresholds were positively 
 correlated with the proportion of parsimony‐informative sites and mean branch support. 
 Using three proxies for estimating site‐specific rate, we found that the most 
 conservative missing data strategies excluded rapidly evolving sites, with four‐state 
 sites present only when allowing ≥60% missing data per SNP. Topological similarity among 
 estimated phylogenies was highest for the data sets with ≥60% missing data per SNP. Our 
 results suggest that several desirable phylogenetic qualities were observed when allowing 
 ≥60% missing data per SNP. However, at the highest missing data thresholds (80% and 90% 
 missing data per SNP), we observed differences in performance between high‐ and 
 mixed‐weight DNA extraction samples, which may indicate there are trade‐offs to 
 consider when using degraded genomic template with RADseq protocols.
