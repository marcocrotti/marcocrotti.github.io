abstract: "Digenea is a wide and diverse group of trematodes, whose members are able to 
 parasitize all classes of vertebrates, and several groups of invertebrates. While the 
 usual life-cycle involves three hosts, a great number of species has evolved to increase 
 or to reduce the number of hosts during development, in order to be more successful in 
 their ecological niche. Differently from other trematodes, digenetic flukes can infect 
 humans, and this process can cause severe diseases like schistosomiasis, which infects 
 around 200 million people worldwide. Finally, digenetic trematodes are not only a threat 
 to humansâ€™ health, but also to the economy, causing millions of dollars losses in 
 activities such as aquaculture and animal husbandry."
