abstract: "As a conservation measure to protect European whitefish in Scotland, a 
 translocated population was established in Loch Sloy from Loch Lomond stock between 
 1988 and 1990. Previous study has assumed that current morphological differences between 
 adults from the donor and refuge lakes have arisen through phenotypic plasticity. The 
 present study compared the morphologies of whitefish at three life stages: alevins and 
 fry raised in a common garden, and wild-caught adults. Alevins were clearly distinguishable 
 by their lake of origin. Loch Sloy alevins were distinguishable also by family, although 
 this was not the case for Loch Lomond. Differential allometric trajectories facilitated 
 the persistence of morphological differences associated with lake of origin through the 
 fry stage into adulthood. Overall, the whitefish from Loch Lomond displayed morphologies 
 associated with pelagic feeders, while the more robust heads and ventrally positioned 
 snouts of the Loch Sloy whitefish conformed to expectations for more benthic feeding 
 habits. That differences between populations were present not only in wild adults, but 
 also in alevins and fry from a common garden setup, strongly suggests that the divergence 
 between populations is due to inheritance mechanisms, rather than differential plastic 
 responses, and questions the effectiveness of translocation as a conservation measure."
