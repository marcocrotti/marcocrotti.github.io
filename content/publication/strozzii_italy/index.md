abstract: _Sus strozzii_ is the only species of Suinae occurring in the first part of 
 Early Pleistocene in Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by a large body 
 size and several morphological similarities with extinct and extant pigs from Island South 
 East Asia (ISEA), such as the Javan Warty Pig S. verrucosus. In this study, a new 
 mandible of _S. strozzii_ from the Early Pleistocene of Pantalla (central Italy) is 
 described and the diagnosis of the species is emended. Based on 52 craniomandibular 
 and dental morphological characters, the first phylogenetic analysis of both living 
 and fossil Eurasian and African Suinae is carried out to reconstruct their 
 relationships. Our results are in agreement with the literature based on molecular 
 and/or morphological analyses. The late Miocene _Microstonyx_ is the first taxon to 
 branch off the monophyletic Suinae clade. The separation between the African 
 (_Kolpochoerus_/_Hylochoerus_ and _Metridiochoerus_/_Phacochoerus_) and the Eurasian (_Sus_) 
 clades occurred early, probably even in the late Miocene. The inclusion of 
 _Potamochoerus_ in the latter group is questionable, being probably due to the retaining 
 of similar plesiomorphic characters in this African pig and in Sus. The Wild Boar 
 _S. scrofa_ and the Earlyâ€“Middle Pleistocene _S. lydekkeri_ are the species of _Sus_ that 
 display the most numerous plesiomorphic character states. They are followed by the 
 monophyletic group of suines that show verrucosic lower canines, which includes the 
 Pliocene _S. arvernensis_, _S. strozzii_, and the extinct and extant verrucosic pigs 
 from ISEA.
