While control interventions have been successful in several endemic regions, mass drug administration has been less effective in others. Here we focus on the impact of repeated praziquantel treatment on the population structure and genetic diversity of Schistosoma mansoni. __Methods:__\nWe examined S. mansoni epidemiology, population genetics, and variation in praziquantel susceptibility in parasites isolated from children across three primary schools in a high endemicity region at the onset of the Ugandan National Control Programme. Children were sampled at 11 timepoints over two years, including one week and four weeks post-praziquantel treatment to evaluate short-term impacts on clearance and evidence of natural variation in susceptibility to praziquantel. __Results:__\nPrevalence of S. mansoni was 85% at baseline. A total of 3576 miracidia larval parasites, isolated from 203 individual children, were genotyped at seven loci. Overall, genetic diversity was high and there was low genetic differentiation, indicating high rates of parasite gene flow. Schistosome siblings were found both pre-treatment and four weeks post-treatment, demonstrating adult worms surviving treatment and natural praziquantel susceptibility variation in these populations at the beginning of mass drug administration. However, we did not find evidence for selection on these parasites. While genetic diversity decreased in the short-term (four weeks post-treatment), diversity did not decrease over the entire period despite four rounds of mass treatment. Furthermore, within-host genetic diversity was affected by host age, host sex, infection intensity and recent praziquantel treatment. __Conclusions:__\nOur findings suggest that praziquantel treatments have short-term impacts on these parasite populations but impacts were transient and no long-term reduction in genetic diversity was observed. High gene flow reduces the likelihood of local adaptation, so even though parasites surviving treatment were observed, these were likely to be diluted at the beginning of the Ugandan National Control Programme. Together, these results suggest that MDA in isolation may be insufficient to reduce schistosome populations in regions with high genetic diversity and gene flow.","tags":["Articles"],"title":"Two-year longitudinal survey reveals high genetic diversity of Schistosoma mansoni with adult worms surviving praziquantel treatment at the start of mass drug administration in Uganda","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["research"],"content":"This is a project I started with a palaeontologist friend on mine for fun few years ago.

Translocations have become an important tool for species conservation, but small population sizes and new ecological pressures might lead to the phenotypic and genotypic divergence of translocated populations. Divergent methylation patterns have been reported between individuals experiencing divergent environmental conditions and, similarly, it has been suggested that epigenetic modifications might compensate for low genetic diversity in bottlenecked populations. While it has been shown that colonisation of a new environment can lead to rapid divergence in phenotypic traits between source and colonising population, the drivers of this divergence and their interaction are not well understood: is phenotypic plasticity, e.g. through epigenetic modifications, the main reason for rapid phenotypic divergence? Is genetic drift the main force behind divergence? Or is phenotypic divergence mainly the result of very rapid genetic adaptation to the new environmental pressures? In Scotland, European whitefish Coregonus lavaretus is natively present in only two lakes, but six refuge populations were established over the last 30 years. We know from phenotypic analyses that these refuge populations have already diverged from the source in several traits after few generations. Therefore, these translocations provide an excellent study system to disentangle the effect of plasticity, drift, and selection in promoting the observed phenotypic divergence between source and colonising populations, and to better understand the impacts colonisation has on the evolution of natural populations.\n","date":1572912000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572912000,"objectID":"26d4faced97e0ad4d099de00ee0ff0f0","permalink":"/project/2.whitefish-translocation/","publishdate":"2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2.whitefish-translocation/","section":"project","summary":"Understanding the impact of translocations at the evolutionary level","tags":["phd"],"title":"Evolutionary implications of translocations","type":"project"},{"authors":["__Marco Crotti__","Colin Adams","Kathryn Elmer"],"categories":null,"content":"Scripts available at my github.\n","date":1565913600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565913600,"objectID":"4e2d78d76e8cdd3d94627eb04f86e199","permalink":"/publication/snps_epirad/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/snps_epirad/","section":"publication","summary":"Epigenetics is increasingly recognised as an important molecular mechanism underlying phenotypic variation. To study DNA methylation in ecological and evolutionary contexts, epiRADseq is a cost-effective next-generation sequencing technique based on reduced representation sequencing of genomic regions surrounding non-/methylated sites. EpiRADseq for genome-wide methylation abundance and ddRADseq for genome-wide SNP genotyping follow very similar library and sequencing protocols, but to date these two types of dataset have been handled separately. Here we test the performance of using epiRADseq data to generate SNPs for population genomic analyses. We tested the robustness of using epiRADseq data for population genomics with two independent datasets: a newly generated single-end dataset for the European whitefish Coregonus lavaretus, and a re-analysis of publicly available, previously published paired-end data on corals. Using standard bioinformatic pipelines with a reference genome and without (i.e. de novo catalogue loci), we compared the number of SNPs retained, population genetic summary statistics, and population genetic structure between data drawn from ddRADseq and epiRADseq library preparations. We find that SNPs drawn from epiRADseq are similar in number to those drawn from ddRADseq, with a 55-83% of SNPs being identified by both methods. Genotyping error rate was 0.88). Furthermore, identical patterns of population genetic structure were recovered using SNPs from epiRADseq and ddRADseq approaches. We show that SNPs obtained from epiRADseq are highly similar to those from ddRADseq and are equivalent for estimating genetic diversity and population structure. This finding is particularly relevant to researchers interested in genetics and epigenetics on the same individuals because using a single epigenomic approach to generate two datasets greatly reduces the time and financial costs compared to using these techniques separately.

Previous study has assumed that current morphological differences between adults from the donor and refuge lakes have arisen through phenotypic plasticity. The present study compared the morphologies of whitefish at three life stages: alevins and fry raised in a common garden, and wild-caught adults. Alevins were clearly distinguishable by their lake of origin. Loch Sloy alevins were distinguishable also by family, although this was not the case for Loch Lomond. Differential allometric trajectories facilitated the persistence of morphological differences associated with lake of origin through the fry stage into adulthood. Overall, the whitefish from Loch Lomond displayed morphologies associated with pelagic feeders, while the more robust heads and ventrally positioned snouts of the Loch Sloy whitefish conformed to expectations for more benthic feeding habits. That differences between populations were present not only in wild adults, but also in alevins and fry from a common garden setup, strongly suggests that the divergence between populations is due to inheritance mechanisms, rather than differential plastic responses, and questions the effectiveness of translocation as a conservation measure.","tags":["Articles"],"title":"Differential selection pressures result in a rapid divergence of donor and refuge populations of a high conservation value freshwater fish Coregonus lavaretus (L.)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Crotti"],"categories":[],"content":" from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

A common feature of RADseq data sets is that they contain missing data that arise from multiple sources including genealogical sampling bias, assembly methodology and sequencing error. Many RADseq studies have demonstrated that allowing sites (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) with missing data can increase support for phylogenetic hypotheses. Two non‐mutually exclusive explanations for this observation are that (a) larger data sets contain more phylogenetic information; and (b) excluding missing data disproportionally removes sites with the highest mutation rates, causing the exclusion of characters that are likely variable and informative. Using a RADseq data set derived from the East African banana frog, *Afrixalus fornasini* (up to 1.1 million SNPs), we found that missing data thresholds were positively correlated with the proportion of parsimony‐informative sites and mean branch support. Using three proxies for estimating site‐specific rate, we found that the most conservative missing data strategies excluded rapidly evolving sites, with four‐state sites present only when allowing ≥60% missing data per SNP. Topological similarity among estimated phylogenies was highest for the data sets with ≥60% missing data per SNP. Our results suggest that several desirable phylogenetic qualities were observed when allowing ≥60% missing data per SNP. However, at the highest missing data thresholds (80% and 90% missing data per SNP), we observed differences in performance between high‐ and mixed‐weight DNA extraction samples, which may indicate there are trade‐offs to consider when using degraded genomic template with RADseq protocols.","tags":["Articles"],"title":"Causes and analytical impacts of missing data in RADseq phylogenetics: Insights from an African frog","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"/contact/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"More info about me","tags":null,"title":"About","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6087c0ef875554f4409ac52928d79279","permalink":"/projects/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"Projects I am working on","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Marco Cherin","Leonardo Sorbelli","__Marco Crotti__","Dawid Iurino","Raffaele Sardella","Antoine Souron"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1534377600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534377600,"objectID":"03c00dfcfc63ed1a7626a9d42f30b311","permalink":"/publication/strozzii_italy/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/strozzii_italy/","section":"publication","summary":"_Sus strozzii_ is the only species of Suinae occurring in the first part of Early Pleistocene in Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by a large body size and several morphological similarities with extinct and extant pigs from Island South East Asia (ISEA), such as the Javan Warty Pig S. verrucosus. In this study, a new mandible of _S. strozzii_ from the Early Pleistocene of Pantalla (central Italy) is described and the diagnosis of the species is emended. Based on 52 craniomandibular and dental morphological characters, the first phylogenetic analysis of both living and fossil Eurasian and African Suinae is carried out to reconstruct their relationships. Our results are in agreement with the literature based on molecular and/or morphological analyses. The late Miocene _Microstonyx_ is the first taxon to branch off the monophyletic Suinae clade. The separation between the African (_Kolpochoerus_/_Hylochoerus_ and _Metridiochoerus_/_Phacochoerus_) and the Eurasian (_Sus_) clades occurred early, probably even in the late Miocene. The inclusion of _Potamochoerus_ in the latter group is questionable, being probably due to the retaining of similar plesiomorphic characters in this African pig and in Sus. The Wild Boar _S. scrofa_ and the Early–Middle Pleistocene _S. lydekkeri_ are the species of _Sus_ that display the most numerous plesiomorphic character states. They are followed by the monophyletic group of suines that show verrucosic lower canines, which includes the Pliocene _S. arvernensis_, _S. strozzii_, and the extinct and extant verrucosic pigs from ISEA.","tags":["Articles"],"title":"New material of Sus strozzii (Suidae, Mammalia) from the Early Pleistocene of Italy and a phylogenetic analysis of suines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emily Waddell*","__Marco Crotti*__","Stephen Lougheed","David Cannatella","Kathryn Elmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521158400,"objectID":"bc2dc858213cb42e6d8acee7b1d51bcb","permalink":"/publication/pristimantis/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pristimantis/","section":"publication","summary":"The Neotropical leaf litter frog genus Pristimantis is very species-rich, with 526 species described to date, but the full extent of its diversity is much higher and remains unknown. This study explores the phylogenetic processes and resulting evolutionary patterns of diversification in Pristimantis. Given the well-recognised failure of morphology- and community-based species groups to describe diversity within the genus, we apply a new test for the presence and phylogenetic distribution of higher evolutionary units. We developed a phylogeny based on 260 individuals encompassing 149 Pristimantis presumed species, sampled at mitochondrial and nuclear genes (3718 base pair alignment), combining new and available sequence data. Our phylogeny broadly agrees with previous studies, both in topology and age estimates, with the origin of Pristimantis at 28.97 (95% HDP =21.59 – 37.33) million years ago (MYA). New taxa that we add to the genus, which had not previously been included in Pristimantis phylogenies, suggest considerable diversity remains to be described. We assessed patterns of lineage origin and recovered 14 most likely (95% CI: 13–19) phylogenetic clusters or higher evolutionary significant units (hESUs) within Pristimantis. Diversification rates decrease towards the present following a density-dependent pattern for Pristimantis overall and for most hESU clusters, reflecting historical evolutionary radiation. The timing of diversification suggests that geological events in the Miocene, such as Andes orogenesis and Pebas system formation and drainage, may have had a direct or indirect impact on the evolution of Pristimantis and thus contributed to the origins of evolutionary independent phylogenetic clusters.","tags":["Articles"],"title":"Hierarchies of evolutionary radiation in the world’s most species rich vertebrate group, the Neotropical Pristimantis leaf litter frogs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark Wilkinson","__Marco Crotti__"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1502841600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1502841600,"objectID":"a9c14b98cc41b95a87d444d08a8a4ebb","permalink":"/publication/roguenarok/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/roguenarok/","section":"publication","summary":"Rogues are relatively unstable taxa in phylogenetic analyses that are of concern if they obfuscate relationships, or support for relationships, of interest among more stable taxa.
